CS 4280, Section 001, Academic Integrity Statement

For this project, AI resources can be used for identifying the location of bugs, as long as they are fully disclosed as described herein. ALL OTHER USES OF AI ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED. Additional non-AI internet resources can be utilized, as long as they are fully disclosed. Furthermore, code written by UMSL students in previous semesters can be looked at, but never copied. 

IMPORTANT: Clearly indicate all outside resources utilized and sign below. Failure to cite the use of outside resources will be reported for appropriate disciplinary actions. Note that discussions with other students are encouraged; looking at each other’s code and/or copying – with or without modifications – are unacceptable and will be reported.

**************************************************************************************************

I hereby certify that all outside resources utilized, other than suggested textbooks and class materials, are clearly noted in my source code and in the following. The start and finish lines of the affected code are shown using ‘start ORx’ and ‘end ORx’, respectively, where ‘x’ is a unique number. Each value of ‘x’ has a corresponding explanation in this Academic Integrity Statement. 

All internet resources include the web address and the date accessed. For each usage of AI, I also include the prompt and code submitted and the output returned. 

All other materials I provide for this project submission are my own original work. I hereby certify that I am responsible for each and every line of code that I submit in my source files and I thoroughly understand how the code works to produce the output. I understand that I may be required to meet with the instructor to answer detailed questions about my submitted code.
